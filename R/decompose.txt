The decompose function for R

Decompose a vector into frequency components

DESCRIPTION:
       Produces k frequency components as a matrix from a vector.

USAGE:
       decompose(x,breaks)

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:
x:       a numeric vector with no missing data
breaks:  a numeric constant or a list of break points into which x should be broken.
         If breaks is a constant then x will be broken into that number of frequncies.
         This argument is passed directly to cut to determine the break points.
         See cut for more details.

VALUE:
       a matrix with dimension nxm where n is the lenght of x and m is the number of
       break categories.

EXAMPLES:
       x <- rnorm(101)
       freq.x <- decompose(x,c(1,10,30,80))
	    # decompose x into 3 frequency categories.
	    # x[,1] represents from 1 to 9 cycles in 101 data points
	    # x[,2] represents from 10 to 29 cycles in 101 data points
	    # x[,3] represents from 30 to 50 cycles in 101 data points
	    # you can only have up to 50 cycles in 101 data points.
